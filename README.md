# Uber Data Analysis Project 🚗📊

## Project Overview 🌟

This project entails a comprehensive analysis of Uber ride data from New York City, aiming to uncover meaningful insights into ride patterns and trends. The dataset comprises approximately half a million entries and is analyzed using Jupyter notebooks along with essential Python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and numpy.

## Key Features 🔍

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilized data preprocessing techniques to extract pertinent information including Date of the month, hour of the day, and day of the week from the raw dataset to facilitate further analysis.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Investigated ride frequency patterns across various dimensions such as Date of the month, hour of the day, and day of the week. Conducted geospatial analysis to visualize ride locations, with darker shades indicating higher ride density areas.
  
- **Insights:** Identified significant insights including peak ride times during the first week (3rd of the month) and month-end (30th of the month), with Wednesday emerging as the day with the highest ride frequency, followed by Tuesday and Saturday.
  
- **Temporal Analysis:** Cross-analyzed day of the week and hour of the day, revealing Wednesday evening at 5:00 PM as the peak ride time with approximately 9000 rides.
  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Highlighted Lower Manhattan, encompassing areas from Wall Street to Central Park, as the region with the highest ride activity, offering valuable insights into popular pickup locations and travel routes within the city.

## Project Structure 📂

- **Data Analysis Script:** Contains Jupyter notebook detailing the data analysis process, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques.
  
- **Result Summaries:** Provides concise summaries of key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
  
- **Visualizations:** Includes visual representations such as plots and maps to illustrate ride patterns and trends effectively.
